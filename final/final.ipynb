    "JSON files are often used not just to store data, but also to store configuration information for how a program should run.  This way, your program doesn't have to be changed when minor configuration changes are all that need to change.  Examples might include database configuration information, source database table names, date ranges for data processing, etc.  The final includes a JSON file that provides important configuration information that will be used to direct the rest of your program on how to combine and process the data from an XML file and a SQL database.  First, however, you'll need to read all the instructions and describe your approach / algorithm for solving the final exam.\n",
