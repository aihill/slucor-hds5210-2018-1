    "\n",
    "We talked in class about several different types of databaes and how they are typically used.  For this first part of the assignment, think about a real-world scenario such where you might need to use a database.  Maybe it's around the collection of claim data, or medical procedures, or drug administration, or public health.  Describe how that data might be managed using two different database types.  Explain why you chose those two and what some of the pros and cons might be of using each database type for that particular scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Describe you scenario\n",
    "2. Pick two different database styles (relational, document, key/value, graph, hadoop) and explain why you chose those two as options for this scenario.\n",
    "3. Explain the pros and cons of each, relative to your scenario\n"
